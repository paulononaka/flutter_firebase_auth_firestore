# flutter bloc for state management and business logic

Date: 2021-07-17

## Decision

Given the many options we have for managing states in Flutter, the author of this project chose one he believes is one of the most used by the Flutter Community (at the time he did the analysis) and also the author is more familiar with it, so we decided to follow along with this to speed up the development process. Flutter Bloc (https://bloclibrary.dev) was chose as a framework to help implement the Bloc pattern, beeing simple, lightweight and highly testable.
