## Decision

We will use Architecture Decision Records, as [described by Michael Nygard](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions) to record the architectural decisions made on this project.

This can be generated manually or using https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools
